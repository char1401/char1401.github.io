            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My full name is Olivia Chartrand Hawkes, I was born in Canada May 30<sup>th</sup> 2005 and I currently live in Ontario. I can speak both French and English which makes me bilingual. My favourite hobbies are playing video games, working on my fitness and taking care of my dog. My dog is a black labrador named Loki, he is very friendly and <em>very</em> food driven.</p>
            <p>The degree I am pursuing at Algonquin is Interactive Media Design. I plan on using the information I learn in this course to assist my future clients on making their projects the best that they can be. I believe the knowledge of <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> will be a very exciting topic to learn.</p>
